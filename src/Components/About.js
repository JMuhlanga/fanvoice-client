                    <h2>About Us</h2>

                    <p>Fan-Voice-Kewas formed in 2022 by Dev-Knights & CO. Sometimes as a sports fan you can sometimes have ideas where your team should be heading , then possibly have a healthy discussion with others about the same, with Fan-voice-ke we offer a platform where one can write a article with regards to their Sport and sport team and others can have a chance to comment of the same.</p>

                    <p>We have many sports and sometimes niche activities, and some of the fans have some things to say about their sports and team, opinions that can unite a sports community or a group of fans to have a healthy discussion with regards to the same .</p>

                    <p> Their opinions can come from a place of love in the sport and can help the sport/team improve. While social media can be a good platform to do so, it tends to spiral off into a convoluted mess whereby conversations or discussions can end up into territories of abuse or asinine remarks.</p>

                    <p>Thus there will be a tendency where others in the sport or team to disregard opinions on social media which in turn can create a real disconnect between the sport/team.</p>

                    <p>This is where Fan-Voice-Ke comes in, where we can offer a platform for fan opinions in the form of articles and give the ability to other fans to rank the other authors while also being involved with the conversation</p>
